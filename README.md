# Getting Started

 To play this online, click [here](https://replit.com/talk/share/Blackjack/139070).

 If you are playing this on computer, you will need Python and pip. And you will need to run

 ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in the same directory as the ``requirements.txt`` file

 before attempting to run the game.

### NOTE: If the colors work for you out of the box, you can ignore the instructions below.

On Pycharm, colors work by default. On VSCode, colors will display properly by default as well.

There are many other methods to get color working, these are just a few examples. 

If you cannot get colors to work or can't be bothered, you can easily disable them by editing the


``COLOR_MODE = True`` 

variables in `ASCII_Cards.py` **and** `Blackjack.py` to 


``COLOR_MODE = False``.
