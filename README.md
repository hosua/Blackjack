# Getting Started

 To play this online, click [here](https://replit.com/talk/share/Blackjack/139070).
### NOTE: If the colors work for you out of the box, you can ignore the instructions below.

On Pycharm, colors work by default. On VSCode, colors will display properly by default as well.

There are many other methods to get color working, these are just a few examples.
