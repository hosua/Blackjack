# Getting Started

 To play this online, click [here](https://replit.com/talk/share/Blackjack/139070).

 If you are playing this on computer, you will need Python and pip. And you will need to run

 ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` in the same directory as the ``requirements.txt`` file

 before attempting to run the game.

 This won't display fonts properly on windows cmd or powershell, so you will have to turn off the ``COLOR_MODE`` variable to false for it to display properly.

``COLOR_MODE = True`` 

variables in `ASCII_Cards.py` **and** `Blackjack.py` to 

``COLOR_MODE = False``.

# Running the Program

For Linux and Mac users, you can run the game with the `run.sh` script by type `./run.sh` in the terminal.

# How to play

Rules are the same as they are in real Blackjack. However, doubling down and split bets are not implemented in this game. 

If you don't know how to play, these are instructions provided in the game itself.
