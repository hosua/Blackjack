To play this online check this [link](https://replit.com/talk/share/Blackjack/139070) out.

# Getting Started

### NOTE: If the colors work for you out of the box, you can ignore the instructions below.

On Pycharm, colors work by default. On Mintty (Git Bash's default) colors will display properly by default as well.

There are many other methods to get color working, these are just a few examples. 

A more detailed thread about this topic can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2048509/how-to-echo-with-different-colors-in-the-windows-command-line).

### If you are on Windows and want to run this in the command prompt:

First, you will need to install [Ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases/tag/v1.89) to display colors in the console correctly. 

For some reason, I could only get 1.60 to work on my computer, but the others theoretically should work for you.

Once you download ansicon, extract either the x64 (64-bit) or x86 (32-bit) folder somewhere, then open it in File Explorer,

Type cmd into where your path is, and this will automatically open the the command prompt in your current directory.

Now type in 'ansicon.exe -i' without quotes. This will install the ansicon plugin for your command prompt.

Your command prompt should be able to properly display colors!

# Running the Program

To run the program, run the Blackjack.py script. The others are just dependencies.
