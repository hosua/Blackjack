Point system:
King, Queen, Jack = 10 points
Ace = 1 or 11 points
Number cards are valued at their respective numbers.

First, place a bet ($500 max)
Once you place a bet, you and the dealer will draw 2 
cards with one of the dealer's cards face down.

During the game, you will have the option to "hit" or "stand". 

"Hitting" will draw another card from the deck. 

"Standing" will end your turn and let the dealer finish their turn.

The goal is to get more points than your opponent without going over 21 points. 

If you go over 21 points, you will automatically lose. 

However, aces are allowed to switch their values at any point in the game. 

Therefore if you have any aces in your hand, your points will be recalculated.

If you get exactly 21 points, you will automatically win and receive a payout of 3:2, 

regular wins will pay 1:1, and ties will not net you any profit but you will receive your money back.
